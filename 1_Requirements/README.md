## Features

When talking about the Jewllery Billing system there are a lot of things that are to be taken into consideration. Here are a few features that would make your JBS.


Now the Common Features of an JBS Include:

A system is something formed of parts, each of which interacts with the other parts to achieve some common purpose.In the case of a billing system,it is a process by which a business bills and invoices customers.


## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- This project involves generating invoice and saving the records
- Reduction of manual work
- Easy to use

### Weaknesses

- Program can breakdown and give false results
- Online systems require good connection
- Open-source systems stores data on computer hardware.This increases the risk of data loss

### Opportunities

- Helps Jewellery Owners to save the invoices of the customers
- Mobile Apllications can be developed


### Threats

- User authentication
- Since these information are accessible by everyone we need to apply another level of security mode to apply for user access


## 4W's and 1'H

The project can be used when the bill needs to be generate,search,showcase.

### Where:

The Jewellery Billing system is nowadays essential for shops.They can use this software as the purpose of generating bill invoice and saving the invoice

### How:

System design is a solution for how to approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
